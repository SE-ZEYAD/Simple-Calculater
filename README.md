# Simple Calculator
Simple Calculator is a basic C++ application designed to perform essential arithmetic operations. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles to ensure clarity and functionality. The application allows users to input numbers and choose arithmetic operations, with results being displayed based on user input. This project demonstrates the practicality of C++ in creating interactive tools.

# Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User Input Handling: Allows users to input numbers and select operations.
Clear Output: Displays results of calculations in a user-friendly manner.
Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes and methods to encapsulate functionality and enhance code readability.

# Technologies Used
C++: The programming language used to implement the calculator logic and user interface.
How to Use
Start the Application: Launch the program to open the calculator.
Enter Numbers: Input the numbers you wish to perform calculations on.
Select Operation: Choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
View Result: The result of the operation will be displayed.
Repeat: Continue performing additional calculations as needed.

# Code Structure
Calculator.cpp: Contains the main logic of the calculator, including arithmetic operations and user interactions.
Calculator.h: Defines the class and methods used for performing calculations.
main.cpp: Manages user input and invokes calculator functions to perform operations.
